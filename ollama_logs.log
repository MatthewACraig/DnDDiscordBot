2025-04-09 17:50:07,095 - Model: wizardlm2:latest | Prompt: can you list all the basic class stuff that barbarians get from level 1 to 20 | Response:  Certainly! Here's a summary of the Barbarian class features from Level 1 to Level 20 in D&D 5e, based on the SRD:

*Level 1:* Rage (including Unarmored Defense), Primal Champion, Ability Score Improvement.
*Level 2:* Danger Sense.
*Level 3:* Feral Instinct.
*Level 4:* Constitution increases by 1.
*Level 5:* Rage (enhanced).
*Level 6:* Athlete (optional feature, replaces Danger Sense).
*Level 7:* Dragon's Fury (replaces Feral Instinct at higher levels).
*Level 8:* Wrath of the Primordial.
*Level 9:* Constitution increases by another 1.
*Level 10:* Rage (even more powerful).
*Level 11:* Brave Heart (replaces Dragon's Fury at higher levels).
*Level 12-20:* You gain one hit die for every odd-numbered level (13, 15, etc.), and your Ability Score Improvement option expands.

Each Rage form (Level 5, Level 10, and Level 14) provides different benefits, and you have the option to take a different form of Rage at these levels. Additionally, every two levels above level 6, you gain another attack while raging. At level 18, you can use your action to enter a rage as many as you like, but no more than once per short or long rest. | Response Time: 6.61s | Average Response Time: 6.61s
